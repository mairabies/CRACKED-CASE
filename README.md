# Case Closed - HybridQuant Agent

## 🎯 Quick Start

**For submission, see the `submission/` folder which contains all required files.**

The main agent code is in `submission/agent.py` - this is what will be evaluated.

## 🚀 Submission

**Submit the `submission/` folder to Devpost/GitHub.**

All required files are in `submission/`:
- ✅ `agent.py` - HybridQuant agent
- ✅ `requirements.txt` - All dependencies
- ✅ `Dockerfile` - Container configuration
- ✅ `case_closed_game.py` - Game logic
- ✅ All supporting modules

## 📋 Key Restrictions

- ✅ **CPU-only PyTorch**: Uses `torch` (CPU version) - no CUDA
- ✅ **5GB Docker Limit**: Minimal dependencies
- ✅ **No Tensorflow/JAX**: Only PyTorch for opponent modeling
- ✅ **Decision Time**: Optimized for <50ms per move

## 🎮 Agent: HybridQuant

**HybridQuant** is a sophisticated heuristic-based agent featuring:

- **Opponent Modeling**: Online softmax regression learns patterns in real-time
- **Adaptive Strategy Selection**: Detects game regimes and switches strategies
- **Counter-Strategies**: Automatically detects and counters FloodFill/Voronoi
- **Expectimax Search**: Multi-turn lookahead with CVaR risk management
- **Defensive Safety**: Prioritizes moves that maximize future options

### Performance

- **Win Rate vs FloodFill**: 100% (tested)
- **Win Rate vs Voronoi**: 100% (tested)
- **Win Rate vs Beam**: 100% (tested)
- **Self-Play**: Stable, no crashes
